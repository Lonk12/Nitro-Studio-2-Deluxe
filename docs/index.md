# About Nitro Studio 2
Nitro Studio 2 is an editor for Nintendo DS sound archives (SDAT) which contain music, sound effects, and anything audio related in general. Nitro Studio 2 is a sequel to my previous DS music editor, Nitro Studio. I felt that I could add a lot more features and make the program easier and intuitive to use by starting from scratch, and I'd say I succeeded. This editor has a lot more features than the old one.

## New Features
Some new features include:
	
	* Sequence editor.
	* Sequence archive editor.
	* Sequence archive sequence playback.
	* Exporting sequences as WAV.
	* Custom MIDI importer/exporter, with the option to use the old one, or even use Nintendo's SDK importer provided you have it.
	* SF2/DLS exporting/importing.
	* SF2 <-> DLS conversion.
	* More accurate saving.
	* More accurate SDK exporting.
	* New and improved bank editor and bank generator.
	* Ability to create SWAVs and STRMs from the tools menu and decide the target encoding.
	* Batch exporting MIDI, SF2, and DLS.
	* Importing and exporting instruments includes sample data.
	* Ability to open any file standalone with Nitro Studio 2.
	* Better group editing.
	* Better usability and feel overall.
	* Trackbar to change position.
	* And more!
